# Predicting Youth Tobacco Use with Machine Learning  

Understanding youth tobacco use is crucial for public health, as most adult smokers start during adolescence. This project leverages **machine learning models** to predict at-risk individuals using data from the **National Youth Tobacco Survey (NTYS)**. By applying ML techniques on the data, we identify key factors contributing to tobacco use.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
- Utilize machine learning to classify youth at risk of tobacco use.  
- Address high-dimensionality and class imbalance using **PCA** and **SMOTE**.  
- Identify influential factors contributing to adolescent tobacco consumption.  

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- **Logistic Regression** achieved **93% recall** and an **F1-score of 76%**, making it the most balanced model.  
- **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** showed strong accuracy (~92%) but were biased toward the majority class.  
- Findings can be used to support **evidence-based public health strategies** for smoking prevention.
