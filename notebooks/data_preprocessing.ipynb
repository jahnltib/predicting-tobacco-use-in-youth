    "# Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "For this phase I didn't do much visualizes I just did a manual deep dive through the questions so far and took the notes below. I created two files `map.py` and `map_annotated.py` containing the original mapping of questions to columnID and an annotated version where I decided to note which columns should be merged, one-hot encoded, or just removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- Many multiple choice questions are already split into separate columns and do not need to be one-hot encoded. But remove any Dummy Variable Trap questions.\n",
    "- Questions that are noted as Categorical need to be one-hot encoded. For example, for QN1, the categories are 0-13, 14-18, 19+, each question needs to be it's own column and have 0 or 1 if they belong to that group.\n",
    "- MERGE to NC means merge to new column, TC = target column\n",
    "  - A MERGE means that if they answered to any of these questions, their value to the new question would be 1. If they didn't answer to any of these questions, their value would be 0.\n",
    "- Questions like \"Why do you currently use e-cigarettes? (They are available in flavors, such as menthol, mint, candy, fruit, or chocolate)\" can be thought of as \n",
    "  \"Responded used e-cigarettes due to it's availability in flavors such as menthol, mint, candy, fruit, or chocolate\".\n",
    "- Skip Logic Questions don't really seem to be a problem as question answers are split into separate columns (as if they were one-hot encoded already) and dummy variable traps can be removed.\n",
    "  All other questions can seemingly be one-hot encoded (split into categories), merged (multiple of them) into new columns, or just removed because they are nto relevant to the analysis.\n",
    "  - The few exceptions of skip logic questions are ones that are removed anyways\n",
    "- Some questions like 48-51 on their own are weird to predict if they relate to tobacco use. For example (Q48) if you are curious about trying a cig\n",
    "  it wouldnt be significant to predict if you are a tobacco user. But if you combined it with smoking in the household, it could be significant, ex.\n",
    "  'Respondent is curious about smoking and is exposed to it within the household'. Just a suggestion.\n",
    "- In hindsight, i overlooked the importance of people potentially using flavored nicotine products vs non-flavored.\n",
    "- Used Q39 and Q100,101 as target label\n",
    "\n",
    "After that I decided to do some data cleaning."

    "# To Do:\n",
    "- Make appropriate transformations in map_annotated before handling missing values.\n",
    "  1. Merge columns together into new columns and drop all the old ones that were previously separate. Similar columns become one umbrella column. Ex. \"Respondent used e-cigarettes due to exposure from friends, media, or family\" encompasses multiple columns and reduces dimensions.\n",
    "  2. Use one-hot encoding to separate a categorical labeled columns into separate columns for each category. Ex. Ages 0-13, 14-18, 19+ become their own categories.\n",
    "  3. Consider combining attributes together that aren't necessarily similar but may be correlated.\n",
    "- Then handle missing values with a high missing rate by replacing it with 0. The reasoning is because:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of QN4: \"QN4B: Are you Hispanic, Latino, Latina, or of Spanish origin? (Yes, Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano, or Chicana)\" a missing response indicates that they are not what the question is asking.\n",
    "So in cases like such, you would not use a median or mean value as it's only 1 or No response (Yes or No).\n",
    "You would also not just drop the column because over 50% of participants left it empty. It just means that 50% or more of participants are not what the question is asking. \n",
    " \n",
    "Another example is QN7: \"QN7: How old were you when you first used an e-cigarette, even once or twice?\". This also has a very high number of missing values for this column. That is because the previous question asks if you have ever used it. So all those who indicated no would skip this question. 0 would represent an absence of the behavior of using an e-cigarette.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the first model we use is multilinear regression, we would ideally want all values to be binary (0/1), so these processes such as one hot encoding and merging and replacing values with 0 after strategically dropping irrelevant columns is preparing us for that.\n"
