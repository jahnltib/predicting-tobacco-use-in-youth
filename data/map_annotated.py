"""
Notes:
- Many multiple choice questions are already split into separate columns and do not need to be one-hot encoded. But remove any Dummy Variable Trap questions.
- Questions that are noted as Categorical need to be one-hot encoded. For example, for QN1, the categories are 0-13, 14-18, 19+, each question needs to be it's own column and have 0 or 1 if they belong to that group.
- MERGE to NC means merge to new column, TC = target column
  - A MERGE means that if they answered to any of these questions, their value to the new question would be 1. If they didn't answer to any of these questions, their value would be 0.
- Questions like "Why do you currently use e-cigarettes? (They are available in flavors, such as menthol, mint, candy, fruit, or chocolate)" can be thought of as 
  "Responded used e-cigarettes due to it's availability in flavors such as menthol, mint, candy, fruit, or chocolate".
- Skip Logic Questions don't really seem to be a problem as question answers are split into separate columns (as if they were one-hot encoded already) and dummy variable traps can be removed.
  All other questions can seemingly be one-hot encoded (split into categories), merged (multiple of them) into new columns, or just removed because they are nto relevant to the analysis.
  - The few exceptions of skip logic questions are ones that are removed anyways
- Some questions like 48-51 on their own are weird to predict if they relate to tobacco use. For example (Q48) if you are curious about trying a cig
  it wouldnt be significant to predict if you are a tobacco user. But if you combined it with smoking in the household, it could be significant, ex.
  'Respondent is curious about smoking and is exposed to it within the household'. Just a suggestion.
- In hindsight, i overlooked the importance of people potentially using flavored nicotine products vs non-flavored.
- Used Q39 and Q100,101 as target label
